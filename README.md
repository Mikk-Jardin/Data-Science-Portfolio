**Computer Vision**
 - [One Man's Trash](https://github.com/Mikk-Jardin/one-mans-trash.git): One-Mans-Trash is a web application that uses deep learning techniques to detect and classify different types of trash objects in images, such as plastic bottles, cans, cups, and plastic bags.

**Natural Language Processing**
 - [Finance Complaint Classifier](https://github.com/Mikk-Jardin/finance-complaint-classifier.git): The Finance Complaint Classifier is a deep learning model designed to identify the financial produc (credit card, loan, mortgage, debt, etc.) that a customer is complaining about based on their complaint narrative.
 - [SkimLit](https://github.com/Mikk-Jardin/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/SkimLit): Deep learning NLP model used for sequential sentence classification of medical paper abstracts. Classifies the sentences of a medical paper's abstract in to the following classes: background, objective, method, result, or conclusion. 

 **Machine Learning**
  - [Superstore Marketing Campaign](https://github.com/Mikk-Jardin/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/0a951f5ff68aa647e6ac49a90fdcf647dc442946/Superstore_Marketing_Campaign/Superstore_Marketing_Campaign.ipynb): A series of exploratory data analysis and model experimentation to aid the marketing campaign of a deal that classifies a customer on their likelihood of availing for the deal.
  - [Beijing Pollution](https://github.com/Mikk-Jardin/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Beijing_Pollution): Time series forecasting on pollution levels of Beijing given different variables like temperature, humidity, etc.
  - [Concrete Compressive Strength](https://github.com/Mikk-Jardin/Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/Concrete_Compressive_Strength): Regression modelling on the strength of concrete given different variations in their formulas.
